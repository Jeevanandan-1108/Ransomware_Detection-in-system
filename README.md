This project focuses on detecting ransomware attacks in a system using machine learning techniques. Ransomware is a harmful malware that locks user data and demands payment to unlock it. Traditional antivirus tools often miss new or evolving ransomware threats. In this system, we use system-level and behavioral data to train ML models that classify files as benign, ransomware, trojan, or spyware. The best-performing model is deployed using a Flask web app for real-time detection. This helps in early threat identification and better system protection.
